- Native iOS share sheet with all standard options:
  - ✅ iMessage
  - ✅ WhatsApp

### 2. Improved Navigation 🏠

**Navigation Bar (Top):**
- **Left:** "🏠 Home" button - Returns to HomeView
- **Right:** "↗️ Share" icon - Opens share sheet
- Both buttons styled with app theme colors

**Action Buttons (Bottom):**
- **Primary:** "Share Results" (gradient button with shadow)
  - Opens iOS share sheet
  - Haptic feedback on tap
- **Secondary:** "Back to Home" (outlined button)
  - Dismisses view and returns to HomeView
  - Clear, intuitive icon

### 3. UX Improvements

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. ✨ Share button is now **prominent** (gradient, shadow)
2. 🏠 Home navigation is **accessible** (top-left, bottom button)
3. 🎯 Clear visual feedback (haptics, animations)

**User Flow:**
```
ResultsView
    ↓
[Tap Share] → iOS Share Sheet → Share via any service
    ↓
[Tap Home] → HomeView (Record tab)
```
