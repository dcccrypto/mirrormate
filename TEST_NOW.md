## 🎯 Test in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Ensure Gemini API Key is Set (30 seconds)

If you haven't already:
1. Get key from: https://ai.google.dev/ → Click "Get API key"
2. Set it:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/khubairnasirm/Desktop/MirrorMate
   npx supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
   ```
3. Verify:
   ```bash
   npx supabase secrets list | grep GEMINI
   ```
   Should show: `GEMINI_API_KEY | [hash]`

### Step 2: Test in the App (2 minutes)

1. **Open MirrorMate** on your iOS device
2. **Record** a 5-10 second video
   - Look at camera
   - Say something (e.g., "This is a test")
3. **Tap "Upload & Analyze"**
4. **Watch the magic happen!** ✨

Expected flow:
```
Converting to MP4...        (1-2s)
  ↓
Uploading video...          (2-4s)
  ↓
Creating session...         (1s)
  ↓
Finalizing...               (1s)

  - Impression Tags
  - Emotion Breakdown
  - Tone Timeline
  - AI Feedback
```

### Step 3: Verify Success (30 seconds)

Check the database:
```bash
npx supabase db execute "SELECT status, error_message, progress FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
```

**Success looks like:**
```
status   | error_message | progress
---------|---------------|----------
complete | null          | 1.0
```

**Failure looks like:**
```
status | error_message        | progress
-------|---------------------|----------
error  | [some error]         | 0.2-0.9
```

If you see an error, check logs in the Supabase Dashboard:
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lchudacxfedkylmjbdsz/functions
- Click `analyze-video-gemini` → Logs tab

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY not configured"
```bash
npx supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### Issue: Analysis stuck at 20%
**Likely causes:**
1. Gemini API key not set
2. Gemini API rate limit hit (free tier: 15 RPM)
3. Video too large (>20MB)

**Check logs:**
- Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lchudacxfedkylmjbdsz/functions
- Look for specific error in `analyze-video-gemini` logs

### Issue: "Video file too large"
- Record shorter videos (< 20 seconds)
- The app already compresses to < 25MB
- If still happens, reduce recording quality in iOS settings

### Issue: "Multipart upload failed"
- Should be fixed in v3
- If persists, check that v3 is deployed:
  ```bash
  npx supabase functions list | grep analyze-video-gemini
  ```
- Should show: `ACTIVE | 3` (or higher)
