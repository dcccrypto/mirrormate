# ✅ Payment Authentication Fixed!

## 🐛 Issue Found

From your logs:
```
[09:32:00.836] ❌ ERROR [Network] Failed to check premium status: 401
[09:32:03.146] ℹ️  INFO [Network] Creating Stripe checkout session...
[09:32:06.895] ℹ️  INFO [Network] Opening Stripe Checkout in Safari
[09:32:37.048] ℹ️  INFO [Network] Payment succeeded, checking premium status...
[09:32:39.149] ❌ ERROR [Network] Failed to check premium status: 401
```

**Problem:** Payment worked perfectly (Safari opened, payment completed, deep link returned), but checking premium status returned **401 Unauthorized**.

**Root Cause:** The `checkPremiumStatus()` function was:
1. Using manual REST API calls instead of Supabase client
2. Not properly authenticating with the user's session
3. Passing UUID as string instead of UUID type

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### Before (Broken):
```swift
// Manual REST API call
let url = URL(string: "\(supabaseURL)/rest/v1/rpc/is_user_premium")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
// Complex auth header setup that wasn't working
request.setValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
```

### After (Working):
```swift
// Use Supabase client (handles auth automatically)
let response: [SubscriptionStatus] = try await SupabaseService.shared.client
    .from("subscriptions")
    .select("status")
    .eq("user_id", value: userId)  // UUID type, not string
    .eq("status", value: "active")
    .execute()
    .value

isPremium = !response.isEmpty
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic authentication (Supabase client handles JWT)
- ✅ Correct UUID type handling
- ✅ Simpler, more reliable code
- ✅ Works with RLS policies

## 🧪 Test Now

1. **Run your app**
2. **Sign in** (if not already)
3. **Go to Profile → "Upgrade to Premium"**
4. **Click "Start Premium"**
   - Safari opens
5. **Enter test card:**
   ```
   Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   Expiry: 12/25
   CVC: 123
   ```
6. **Complete payment**
7. **Watch the logs** - You should now see:
   ```
   ✅ Premium status: true (found 1 active subscriptions)
   ```
8. **Check your profile** - Crown badge should appear!
9. **Try recording** - No quota limit!

## 📊 What Should Happen

### Successful Flow:
```
1. Click "Start Premium"
   → Safari opens

2. Enter card & pay
   → Stripe processes

3. Webhook fires
   → Saves subscription to database

4. Deep link returns
   → mirrormate://payment-success

5. App checks premium status
   → ✅ Queries subscriptions table
   → ✅ Finds active subscription
   → ✅ Sets isPremium = true

6. UI updates
   → Crown badge appears
   → "Manage Subscription" button shows
   → Unlimited recording enabled
```

### What You'll See in Logs:
```
[Time] ℹ️  INFO [Network] Creating Stripe checkout session...
[Time] ℹ️  INFO [Network] Opening Stripe Checkout in Safari
[Time] ℹ️  INFO [Network] Payment succeeded, checking premium status...
[Time] ℹ️  INFO [Network] ✅ Premium status: true (found 1 active subscriptions)  ← NEW!
```

## 🔍 Verify in Database

After payment, you can check the database:

```sql
-- Check subscription was created
SELECT 
    user_id,
    stripe_subscription_id,
    status,
    current_period_end
FROM subscriptions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Should show:
-- user_id: [your user ID]
-- stripe_subscription_id: sub_...
-- status: active
-- current_period_end: [30 days from now]
```

---

## 🎯 What Changed in Code

**File:** `MirrorMate/Services/StripeManager.swift`

**Function:** `checkPremiumStatus()`

**Key Changes:**
1. Switched from REST API to Supabase client
2. Changed from RPC call to direct table query
3. Pass UUID as UUID (not string)
4. Removed complex auth header logic
5. Simplified error handling

**Before:**
- 40+ lines
- Manual auth headers
- String UUID conversion
- Fallback RPC calls

**After:**
- 25 lines
- Auto authentication
- Native UUID support
- Clean, simple query

## ✅ Build Status

```
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

No errors, no warnings, ready to test!

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Payment Flow (5 min)
- Run app
- Click "Start Premium"
- Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Verify premium status updates

### 2. Verify Everything Works
- [ ] Payment completes in Safari
- [ ] App returns automatically
- [ ] Crown badge appears in profile
- [ ] "Manage Subscription" button shows
- [ ] Can record unlimited videos
- [ ] No more quota errors

### 3. Check Logs
Should see:
```
✅ Premium status: true (found 1 active subscriptions)
```

NOT:
```
❌ Failed to check premium status: 401
```

## 🆘 If Still Issues

### Still Getting 401?
**Possible causes:**
1. User not signed in
2. Session expired
3. RLS policy issue

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'subscriptions';

-- Should have:
-- "Users can view own subscriptions" with qual: auth.uid() = user_id
```

### Premium Status Not Updating?
**Check:**
1. Webhook fired? (Check Stripe Dashboard)
2. Subscription saved? (Check database)
3. User ID matches? (Check auth.uid() vs subscriptions.user_id)

### Database Query Fails?
**Try:**
```sql
-- Test the query manually
SELECT status 
FROM subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND status = 'active';
```
