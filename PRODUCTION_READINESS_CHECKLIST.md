## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Crash Reporting with Sentry

```swift
// 1. Add to Package Dependencies
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "8.0.0")

// 2. In MirrorMateApp.swift
import Sentry

@main
struct MirrorMateApp: App {
    init() {
        SentrySDK.start { options in
            options.dsn = "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN"
            options.debug = false
            options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
            options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0
            
            // Capture breadcrumbs
            options.enableAutoSessionTracking = true
            options.enableCaptureFailedRequests = true
        }
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}

// 3. In critical error handling blocks
catch {
    SentrySDK.capture(error: error)
    AppLog.error("Upload failed: \(error)", category: .upload)
}
```

---

### 2. Analytics with PostHog

```swift
// 1. Add PostHog SDK
// Package: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios

// 2. In MirrorMateApp.swift
import PostHog

let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
config.host = "https://app.posthog.com" // or self-hosted
PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)

// 3. Track events throughout app
// In RecordView.swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("recording_started")
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("recording_completed", properties: [
    "duration": elapsed,
    "file_size": fileSize
])

// In ResultsView.swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("results_viewed", properties: [
    "confidence_score": report.confidenceScore,
    "filler_words_count": totalFillerWords
])

// In PaywallView.swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("paywall_shown")

// In StoreKitManager.swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("subscription_purchased", properties: [
    "product_id": productId,
    "price": price
])
```

---

### 3. Rate Limiting in Edge Functions

```typescript
// supabase/functions/_shared/rateLimiter.ts
export async function checkRateLimit(
  supabase: any,
  userId: string,
  action: string,
  limit: number,
  windowMinutes: number
): Promise<boolean> {
  const windowStart = new Date(Date.now() - windowMinutes * 60 * 1000);
  
  const { count, error } = await supabase
    .from('rate_limits')
    .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .eq('action', action)
    .gte('created_at', windowStart.toISOString());
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Rate limit check error:', error);
    return true; // Fail open (allow request if check fails)
  }
  
  return (count || 0) < limit;
}

export async function recordRateLimit(
  supabase: any,
  userId: string,
  action: string
) {
  await supabase
    .from('rate_limits')
    .insert({
      user_id: userId,
      action: action,
      created_at: new Date().toISOString()
    });
}

// In init-session/index.ts
import { checkRateLimit, recordRateLimit } from '../_shared/rateLimiter.ts';

const canProceed = await checkRateLimit(
  supabase,
  user_id,
  'init_session',
  10, // 10 sessions
  60  // per hour
);

if (!canProceed) {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ 
      error: 'Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in a few minutes.' 
    }),
    { status: 429, headers: corsHeaders }
  );
}

await recordRateLimit(supabase, user_id, 'init_session');
```

Create the rate_limits table:

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20250119000005_add_rate_limits.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rate_limits (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_rate_limits_user_action_time 
ON rate_limits(user_id, action, created_at DESC);

-- Cleanup old entries (keep last 24 hours)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_rate_limits()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rate_limits
  WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Schedule cleanup every hour
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-rate-limits',
  '0 * * * *',
  'SELECT cleanup_rate_limits()'
);
```

---

### 4. Database Backups Configuration

```sql
-- Enable Point-in-Time Recovery in Supabase Dashboard
-- Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups ‚Üí Enable PITR

-- Create manual backup script
-- supabase/scripts/backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backups/backup_$TIMESTAMP.sql
echo "Backup created: backup_$TIMESTAMP.sql"

-- Add to .gitignore
backups/
*.sql
```

## üí∞ Cost Analysis & Monitoring

### Expected Monthly Costs

#### Infrastructure
| Service | Tier | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| Supabase | Pro | $25/month | Required for production |
| Gemini API | Pay-as-you-go | ~$10/month | $0.001 per video (estimate 10K/month) |
| Sentry | Team | $26/month | 50K events (has free tier) |
| PostHog | Free | $0 | Up to 1M events (then $0.000225/event) |
| App Store | Developer | $99/year | One-time annual |

**Total: ~$61-71/month** (+ $99/year App Store)

#### Break-even Analysis
- With $4.99/month subscription
- Need ~13 paying subscribers to break even
- At 10% conversion rate, need 130 active users

### Cost Monitoring Setup

```typescript
// Track API costs in Edge Functions
// Add to analyze-video-gemini/index.ts
const estimatedCost = videoSizeBytes * 0.001 / 1000000; // rough estimate

await supabase
  .from('cost_tracking')
  .insert({
    user_id: userId,
    action: 'gemini_analysis',
    estimated_cost: estimatedCost,
    created_at: new Date().toISOString()
  });

// Create cost tracking table
CREATE TABLE cost_tracking (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  estimated_cost DECIMAL(10, 6) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Query monthly costs
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  SUM(estimated_cost) as total_cost
FROM cost_tracking
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

---

## üîí Security Checklist

- [ ] User authentication required for all sensitive operations
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all API calls
- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] SQL injection protection (using Supabase client, not raw SQL)

### RLS Policies to Verify

```sql
-- Check existing policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Ensure these are in place:
-- sessions: Users can only see their own
-- analysis_reports: Users can only see their own
-- user_quotas: Users can only read their own
```

-- Active users today
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) 
FROM sessions 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Conversion rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as total_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN is_premium THEN user_id END) as premium_users,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN is_premium THEN user_id END)::float / 
   COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)::float * 100) as conversion_rate
FROM user_quotas;

-- Average videos per user
SELECT AVG(video_count) as avg_videos
FROM (
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as video_count
  FROM sessions
  GROUP BY user_id
) subquery;
```

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why Supabase?** Rapid development, built-in auth, real-time, cost-effective
- **Why Gemini?** Better video analysis than GPT-4o Vision, lower cost
- **Why SwiftUI?** Modern, maintainable, less code

### Design Decisions  
- **Why TabView?** Standard iOS pattern, easy navigation
- **Why $4.99/month?** Competitive with similar apps, premium positioning
- **Why 3 free analyses?** Enough to see value, low enough to convert

### What We're Not Doing (V1)
- ‚ùå iPad optimization (phone-first)
- ‚ùå Offline mode (complexity vs value)
- ‚ùå Social features (focus on core value)
- ‚ùå Multiple languages (English-only launch)
- ‚ùå Android (iOS-first strategy)
