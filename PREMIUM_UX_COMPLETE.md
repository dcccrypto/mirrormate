## 🐛 What Was Wrong

### Issue 1: Paywall Showing for Premium Users

**Problem:**
- User paid successfully ✅
- Subscription saved to database ✅
- But still saw paywall when trying to record ❌

**Root Cause:**
`StripeManager.checkPremiumStatus()` was only called once at app init, but the `@Published var isPremium` wasn't updating views properly.

**Fix:**
- Added `.onAppear` to `RecordView` to refresh premium status
- Added `.onAppear` to `ProfileView` to refresh premium status
- Added visual premium badge in `RecordView` so users KNOW they're premium

### Issue 2: Upgrade Button for Premium Users

**Problem:**
- Premium users were seeing "Upgrade to Premium" in ProfileView

**Fix:**
- Already had `if !stripe.isPremium` conditional ✅
- Added `else` block with "Manage Subscription" button for premium users
- This opens Stripe Customer Portal for billing management

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### RecordView - Premium Badge (NEW!)

```swift
// Top-left corner of camera view
if stripe.isPremium {
    HStack(spacing: 6) {
        Image(systemName: "crown.fill")
            .foregroundColor(AppTheme.Colors.accent)
        Text("Premium")
            .font(AppTheme.Fonts.caption())
    }
    .padding(.horizontal, AppTheme.Spacing.md)
    .padding(.vertical, AppTheme.Spacing.sm)
    .background(.ultraThinMaterial, in: Capsule())
    .overlay(
        Capsule()
            .stroke(AppTheme.Colors.accent.opacity(0.5), lineWidth: 1)
    )
}

- Users needed to see visual confirmation they're premium
- Premium users were seeing upgrade buttons

Now:
- ✅ Premium status refreshes on every view
- ✅ Premium badge shows in camera
- ✅ Premium users see "Manage Subscription" 
- ✅ Free users see "Upgrade to Premium"
- ✅ Paywall only for free users
