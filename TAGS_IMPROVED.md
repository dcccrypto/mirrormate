# ✅ Impression Tags Fixed - Better Context & Clarity

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The impression tags like "clean" and "confident" were appearing **out of place** and lacked proper context, making users confused about what these tags meant.

### Issues:
1. ❌ Tags had no explanation (users didn't know what they represented)
2. ❌ Generic label "Impression Tags" was unclear
3. ❌ AI could generate random/inappropriate tags
4. ❌ No visual hierarchy or description

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved AI Prompt** (Backend)

Updated the Gemini analysis prompt to provide a **curated list** of appropriate communication tags:

**Before:**
```typescript
"impressionTags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"] 
(e.g., "confident", "friendly", "nervous")
```

**After:**
```typescript
"impressionTags": [...] 
(Choose ONLY from these options: "confident", "friendly", "nervous", 
"engaging", "professional", "approachable", "enthusiastic", "calm", 
"energetic", "articulate", "authentic", "polished", "relaxed", 
"poised", "warm", "natural", "credible", "composed", "dynamic", 
"persuasive". Use 4-5 tags that best describe their communication 
style and presence.)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent, professional tags
- ✅ All tags are communication-relevant
- ✅ No weird or out-of-context tags
- ✅ Limited to 20 curated options

---

### 2. **Better UI Context** (Frontend)

Updated ResultsView to make tags more meaningful:

**Before:**
```swift
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "tag.fill")
    Text("Impression Tags")  // ❌ Unclear
}
TagCloudView(tags: tags)
```

**After:**
```swift
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "person.wave.2.fill")  // ✅ Person icon
    Text("First Impression")  // ✅ Clear label
}
Text("How you come across to others")  // ✅ Description!
TagCloudView(tags: tags)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear section title ("First Impression")
- ✅ Descriptive subtitle explains purpose
- ✅ Better icon (person waving)
- ✅ Users understand context immediately
