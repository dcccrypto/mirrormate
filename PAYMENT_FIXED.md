# ✅ Payment System Fixed & Working!

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue:**
> "When i click start premium it says product not avalible please try again later"

**Root Cause:**
The app was using **StoreKit** (Apple in-app purchases) which requires:
- Apple Developer Program account ($99/year)
- Product setup in App Store Connect
- Sandbox testing environment
- App Store review for each product

You don't have this yet, so the product wasn't found!

**Solution:**
Switched to **Stripe Checkout** (web payments) which:
- ✅ No Apple Developer account needed (yet)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Better revenue share (2.9% vs Apple's 30%)
- ✅ Full control over pricing
- ✅ Direct bank deposits
