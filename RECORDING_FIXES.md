# üé• Recording Issues - FIXED

## Issues Reported

1. ‚ùå **Black screen while recording** - Camera preview not showing
2. ‚ùå **No upload button after recording** - Cannot upload and analyze
3. ‚ùå **Recording flow broken** - No way to complete the analysis process

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: Black Camera Screen
**Cause**: Preview layer wasn't properly connected to the capture session on the main thread.
- The `previewLayer.session` assignment was happening on a background thread
- AVFoundation UI updates must happen on the main thread
- Missing comprehensive logging made debugging difficult

### Issue 2: Missing Upload Button
**Cause**: Multiple async/threading issues:
- `lastRecordedURL` state wasn't being updated on the main thread
- Async quota check in `toggleRecording()` was causing timing issues
- Recording callback wasn't guaranteed to run on main thread

### Issue 3: Async State Management
**Cause**: The async quota check was wrapped in `Task` without proper `@MainActor` isolation
- State updates happening on background threads
- SwiftUI not re-rendering when state changed off main thread

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Camera Configuration (CameraViewController.swift)

#### ‚úÖ Added MainActor for Preview Layer
```swift
// CRITICAL: Set preview layer session on main thread
await MainActor.run {
    previewLayer.session = captureSession
    AppLog.info("‚úì Preview layer connected to session", category: .capture)
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Enhanced Logging Throughout
```swift
AppLog.info("Configuring camera...", category: .capture)
AppLog.info("‚úì Video input added (camera: front/back)", category: .capture)
AppLog.info("‚úì Audio input added", category: .capture)
AppLog.info("‚úì Video output added", category: .capture)
AppLog.info("‚úì Camera configuration complete", category: .capture)
AppLog.info("Camera session started running", category: .capture)
```

#### ‚úÖ Better Error Handling
```swift
guard let device = front ?? back else {
    AppLog.error("No camera device found", category: .capture)
    throw NSError(domain: "Camera", code: -1, ...)
}
// ... detailed error messages for each step
```

### Fix 2: Recording Callback (RecordView.swift)

#### ‚úÖ Main Thread State Updates
```swift
CameraView(isRecording: $isRecording, outputURL: outputURL, ...) { url, err in
    AppLog.info("Recording finished callback...", category: .capture)
    
    // CRITICAL: Update state on main thread
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        guard err == nil, let fileURL = url else {
            AppLog.error("Recording error: \(err?.localizedDescription ?? "unknown")", category: .capture)
            errorMessage = "Recording failed. Please try again."
            HapticFeedback.error.trigger()
            return
        }
        
        AppLog.info("‚úì Recording saved to: \(fileURL.path)", category: .capture)
        AppLog.info("‚úì File exists: \(FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: fileURL.path))", category: .capture)
        
        // Set the recorded URL - this triggers upload button to appear
        lastRecordedURL = fileURL
        HapticFeedback.success.trigger()
        
        AppLog.info("‚úì lastRecordedURL set, upload button should appear", category: .capture)
    }
}
```

### Fix 3: Toggle Recording Logic

#### ‚úÖ Simplified and Fixed Async Quota Check
```swift
private func toggleRecording() {
    AppLog.info("toggleRecording called, isRecording=\(isRecording)", category: .capture)
    
    // If currently recording, just stop
    if isRecording {
        isRecording = false
        AppLog.info("Stopping recording...", category: .capture)
        return
    }
    
    // Starting a NEW recording - clear previous recording and check quota
    lastRecordedURL = nil
    AppLog.info("Cleared previous recording URL", category: .capture)
    
    Task { @MainActor in  // ‚Üê CRITICAL: @MainActor ensures state updates on main thread
        let canAnalyze = await QuotaService.shared.canAnalyzeToday(isPremium: store.isPremium)
        if !canAnalyze {
            AppLog.warning("Daily quota exceeded, showing paywall", category: .ui)
            showPaywall = true
            HapticFeedback.warning.trigger()
            return
        }
        
        // Quota available - start recording
        AppLog.info("Starting recording...", category: .capture)
        isRecording = true
    }
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Clear Previous Recording on New Recording
- Ensures upload button disappears when starting new recording
- Prevents confusion from old recorded files

### Fix 4: Debug Helper

#### ‚úÖ Visual Feedback for Debugging
```swift
if let readyURL = lastRecordedURL, !isRecording {
    // Upload button appears here
} else {
    // Debug: Show why button isn't appearing
    if !isRecording {
        Text("lastRecordedURL: \(lastRecordedURL == nil ? "nil" : "exists")")
            .font(AppTheme.Fonts.caption())
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .padding(8)
            .background(Color.black.opacity(0.5))
            .cornerRadius(8)
    }
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Camera Preview
1. Open app ‚Üí Navigate to Record screen
2. **Expected**: Camera preview shows immediately (front camera)
3. **Check logs**: Should see:
   ```
   Configuring camera...
   ‚úì Video input added (camera: front)
   ‚úì Audio input added
   ‚úì Video output added
   ‚úì Preview layer connected to session
   ‚úì Camera configuration complete
   Camera session started running
   ```

### Test 2: Recording Flow
1. Tap record button (red circle)
2. **Expected**: 
   - Timer starts
   - Red recording indicator pulses
   - Status text: "Tap to stop"
3. Record for 5-10 seconds
4. Tap stop button
5. **Expected**:
   - Timer stops
   - Upload button appears: "Upload & Analyze"
6. **Check logs**: Should see:
   ```
   Recording finished callback...
   ‚úì Recording saved to: /path/to/file.mov
   ‚úì File exists: true
   ‚úì lastRecordedURL set, upload button should appear
   ‚úì‚úì‚úì Upload button appeared on screen!
   ```

### Test 3: Upload Button
1. After recording stops
2. **Expected**: Large blue "Upload & Analyze" button at bottom
3. If button doesn't appear, check debug text that shows:
   - "lastRecordedURL: exists" (should say "exists", not "nil")
4. Tap "Upload & Analyze"
5. **Expected**: Navigate to ProcessingView with animation

### Test 4: Multiple Recordings
1. Record video #1 ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Upload button appears
2. Tap record again (don't upload)
3. **Expected**:
   - Upload button disappears
   - New recording starts
   - Previous recording cleared
4. Stop recording
5. **Expected**: Upload button appears for new recording

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds ‚úÖ
- [ ] Camera preview shows (not black)
- [ ] Recording starts when tapping button
- [ ] Timer counts during recording
- [ ] Recording stops when tapping button
- [ ] Upload button appears after stopping
- [ ] Upload button is tappable
- [ ] Processing screen appears after upload
- [ ] Logs show detailed flow in console

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Camera still shows black screen
**Solution**: Check Xcode console for error messages
```bash
# Look for these error patterns:
"‚ùå ERROR [Capture] No camera device found"
"‚ùå ERROR [Capture] Failed to create video input"
"‚ùå ERROR [Capture] Cannot add video input to session"
```

### Issue: Upload button still doesn't appear
**Solution**: Check logs for:
```bash
# Should see:
"‚úì Recording saved to: /path/to/file"
"‚úì File exists: true"
"‚úì lastRecordedURL set, upload button should appear"

# If you see:
"lastRecordedURL: nil"
# Then the recording callback isn't firing properly
```

### Issue: Button appears but file doesn't upload
**Solution**: Check network logs:
```bash
# Look for:
"‚Üí POST https://...supabase.co/functions/v1/init-session"
"‚úì Session created: <session-id>"
"‚Üí Starting signed upload"
```

## Performance Notes

- Camera configuration happens async (doesn't block UI)
- Preview layer update forced to main thread (prevents black screen)
- State updates guaranteed on main thread (prevents SwiftUI issues)
- Comprehensive logging (helps debug in production)

## What to Expect

### Before Recording
- ‚úÖ Camera preview visible
- ‚úÖ Record button (red circle) ready
- ‚úÖ "Tap to record" text

### During Recording
- ‚úÖ Timer counting up (00:05, 00:06, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Red pulsing dot
- ‚úÖ "Tap to stop" text
- ‚úÖ Record button shows stop icon (square)

### After Recording

- ‚úÖ Upload button appears with animation
- ‚úÖ "Upload & Analyze" text clearly visible
- ‚úÖ Button is large and prominent (full width)
- ‚úÖ Blue gradient background
- ‚úÖ Haptic feedback on tap
