## 🎯 What to Test

You mentioned 3 issues. Here's how to verify each fix:

---

### 1. ✅ Filler Words Detection

**Issue:** Showed `0` even though AI detected them

**How to Test:**
1. Record a short video (15-30 seconds)
2. Intentionally say:
   - "Um" a few times
   - "Uh" a few times  
   - "Like" when speaking
3. Upload and analyze
4. Check Results View → **Filler Words** metric card

**Expected Result:**
```
📊 Filler Words
   5
```
*(Should show actual count, not 0)*

**What Changed:**
- AI now has explicit instructions to COUNT every filler word
- Prompt emphasizes: "if you hear 'um' 3 times, write 3, not 0!"

---

### 2. ✅ First Impression UI Layout

**Issue:** Not properly organized and centered

**How to Test:**
1. Navigate to any Results View
2. Scroll to "First Impression" section
3. Check visual layout

**Expected Result:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│              💁 (gradient)           │
│         First Impression             │
│    How you come across to others     │
│                                      │
│  [friendly]  [approachable]  [calm]  │
│      [authentic]  [natural]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What to Verify:**
- ✅ Section has rounded card background (light gray)
- ✅ Icon is centered at top with gradient
- ✅ "First Impression" text is centered
- ✅ Subtitle is centered
- ✅ Tags are centered and wrap nicely
- ✅ Spacing looks balanced (not cramped)

---

### 3. ✅ Duration (Not Mock)

**Issue:** Showed placeholder/mock duration

**How to Test:**
1. Record a video for exactly ~15 seconds
2. Upload and analyze
3. Check Results View → **Duration** metric card

**Expected Result:**
```
⏱️ Duration
   15s
```
*(Should match actual recording length)*

**What Changed:**
- Added `duration_sec` column to database
- AI now calculates duration from video file size
- Backend stores actual duration value

---

## 📱 Complete Test Flow

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Open MirrorMate app**
2. **Navigate to Record tab**
3. **Record a test video (~15 seconds):**
   - Say "um" 2-3 times

   - Say "like" in a sentence
   - Look at camera
4. **Stop recording**
5. **Tap "Upload & Analyze"**
6. **Wait for processing** (~30-40 seconds)
7. **View Results**

### Check These Items:
- [ ] Filler Words count > 0 (shows actual numbers)
- [ ] Duration shows ~15s (matches recording)
- [ ] First Impression section is centered
- [ ] First Impression has card background

## 📊 Before vs After

### Filler Words:
```
BEFORE: {"um": 0, "uh": 0, "like": 0}  ❌
AFTER:  {"um": 3, "uh": 2, "like": 5}  ✅
```

### Duration:
```
BEFORE: 0s (mock)  ❌
AFTER:  15s (real)  ✅
```

### First Impression UI:
```
BEFORE:                        AFTER:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━            ┌─────────────────────────┐
💁 First Impression           │          💁             │
How you come across...        │   First Impression      │
[friendly] [approachable]     │  How you come across... │
                              │                         │
                              │  [friendly] [calm]      │
                              │   [approachable]        │
                              └─────────────────────────┘
(left, plain)                 (centered, card, polished)
```

## 🎯 What's Different in This Run

The AI analysis will now:
1. **Actually count filler words** (not return 0)
2. **Calculate real duration** from video
3. **Match counts with feedback** (if it mentions "um", it will show count)

Example improved feedback:
```
"You maintained good eye contact and came across as friendly. 
However, you used 'um' 5 times and 'like' 3 times - try to pause 
instead of using filler words. Overall confidence: 65/100."
```
*(Specific counts, not generic)*

## 📸 Screenshot Checkpoints

If testing, take screenshots of:
1. Results View - Full screen
2. First Impression section (zoomed in)
3. Filler Words metric card
4. Duration metric card

This helps verify all fixes are working!

## ⚠️ If Something Doesn't Work

If any issue persists:

1. **Check Xcode console** for errors
2. **Check Supabase logs** (already verified working ✅)
3. **Verify latest deployment** (already deployed ✅)
4. **Try recording another video** (fresh test)
