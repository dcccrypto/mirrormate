# 🚨 URGENT: Webhook Not Configured!

## 🐛 The Problem

Your logs show:
```
[09:35:57.906] ℹ️  INFO [Network] Payment succeeded, checking premium status...
[09:36:00.516] ℹ️  INFO [Network] ✅ Premium status: false (found 0 active subscriptions)
```

**Stripe charged the card successfully**, but the subscription isn't in your database because:

❌ **You haven't configured the webhook in Stripe Dashboard yet!**

Without the webhook:
1. ✅ Payment completes in Stripe
2. ❌ Stripe can't notify your app
3. ❌ Subscription never gets saved to database
4. ❌ User stays as "free"

---

## ✅ Fix It Now (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Stripe Webhooks
Go to: **https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks**

(Make sure you're in **TEST MODE** - toggle in top right)

### Step 2: Add Endpoint
Click **"+ Add endpoint"** button

### Step 3: Enter URL
**Endpoint URL:**
```
https://lchudacxfedkylmjbdsz.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

**Description:**
```
MirrorMate subscription webhooks
```

### Step 4: Select Events
Click **"Select events"**, then choose these **5 events**:

```
✅ checkout.session.completed
✅ customer.subscription.created  
✅ customer.subscription.updated
✅ customer.subscription.deleted
✅ invoice.payment_failed
```

### Step 5: Add Endpoint
Click **"Add endpoint"** button at the bottom

### Step 6: Get Webhook Secret
After creating, you'll see:
```
Signing secret
whsec_••••••••••••••••
         [Reveal]  [Roll]
```

Click **"Reveal"** and copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)

### Step 7: Set Secret in Supabase
Run this command:
```bash
cd /Users/khubairnasirm/Desktop/MirrorMate
npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_COPIED_SECRET
```

### Step 8: Test the Webhook
Back in Stripe webhook page:
1. Click **"Send test webhook"**
2. Select event: **`checkout.session.completed`**
3. Click **"Send test webhook"**
4. You should see: ✅ **Response: 200**

If you see an error, check the response details.

## 🧪 Test Again

Now that the webhook is configured:

1. **Go back to your app**
2. **Try payment again:**
   - Profile → Upgrade to Premium
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete payment

3. **This time you should see:**
   ```
   ✅ Premium status: true (found 1 active subscriptions)
   ```

4. **Check database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM subscriptions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
   
   Should show your new subscription!

## 🔍 What Will Happen Now

### Before (Broken):
```
Payment completes in Stripe
    ↓
❌ Stripe tries to send webhook
    ↓
❌ No endpoint configured
    ↓
❌ Webhook fails silently
    ↓
❌ Subscription never saved
    ↓
❌ User stays as "free"
```

### After (Working):
```
Payment completes in Stripe
    ↓
✅ Stripe sends webhook to your endpoint
    ↓
✅ stripe-webhook function receives event
    ↓
✅ Saves subscription to database
    ↓
✅ User becomes premium
    ↓
✅ Crown badge appears
```

## 📊 Verify Webhook is Working

### In Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click **"Events"** tab
4. You should see events being delivered

### In Supabase Logs:
After payment, you should see calls to `stripe-webhook` function:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lchudacxfedkylmjbdsz/logs/edge-functions
```

Look for:
```
POST | 200 | .../functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

### In Your Database:
```sql
-- Check if subscription was created
SELECT 
    user_id,
    stripe_subscription_id,
    status,
    created_at
FROM subscriptions 
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### You MUST Configure Webhook
Without the webhook:
- Payments will complete
- Money will be charged
- But subscriptions won't activate
- Users will be confused and angry

### Test Mode vs Live Mode
- **Test Mode:** Use test cards (4242...)
- **Live Mode:** Use real cards

**You need to set up SEPARATE webhooks for Test and Live!**

When you go live:
1. Switch Stripe to Live mode
2. Create a NEW webhook endpoint (same URL)
3. Get the LIVE webhook secret
4. Update: `npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_LIVE_SECRET`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Returns Error
**Check:**
1. URL is correct (no typos)
2. Function is deployed: `npx supabase functions list`
3. Secret is set: `npx supabase secrets list`

### Still No Subscriptions After Payment
**Check:**
1. Webhook was fired (Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Events)
2. Webhook returned 200 (check event details)
3. Function logs (Supabase → Edge Functions → Logs)
4. Database has subscription (run SQL query)

### Webhook Shows 401 or 403
**Problem:** Missing or wrong `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
**Fix:**
```bash
npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET
```

### Webhook Shows 500
**Problem:** Function error
**Fix:** Check function logs for details:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lchudacxfedkylmjbdsz/logs/edge-functions
```
