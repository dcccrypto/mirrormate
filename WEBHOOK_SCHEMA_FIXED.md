# ✅ FIXED: Webhook Schema Mismatch!

## 🐛 The Real Problem

After you configured everything correctly, the webhook **WAS being called** by Stripe, but it was **silently failing** to save subscriptions!

### Why?

The `stripe-webhook` function was trying to insert into the `subscriptions` table, but it was **missing required fields**!

**Required by database:**
- `transaction_id` ❌ Not provided
- `product_id` ❌ Not provided  
- `expires_at` ❌ Not provided
- `purchased_at` ❌ Not provided

**Result:**
```
Stripe → Webhook called → Database INSERT fails → Returns 200 OK anyway → Subscription never saved
```

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Updated Webhook Function

**File:** `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
await supabase.from("subscriptions").insert({
  user_id: userId,
  stripe_subscription_id: subscription.id,
  status: subscription.status,
  // Missing: transaction_id, product_id, expires_at, purchased_at
});
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
await supabase.from("subscriptions").insert({
  user_id: userId,
  stripe_subscription_id: subscription.id,
  stripe_customer_id: subscription.customer as string,
  transaction_id: session.id, // ✅ Added
  product_id: subscription.items.data[0].price.product as string, // ✅ Added
  status: subscription.status,
  price_id: subscription.items.data[0].price.id,
  quantity: subscription.items.data[0].quantity || 1,
  current_period_start: new Date(subscription.current_period_start * 1000).toISOString(),
  current_period_end: currentPeriodEnd,
  expires_at: currentPeriodEnd, // ✅ Added
  purchased_at: now, // ✅ Added
  trial_end: subscription.trial_end ? new Date(subscription.trial_end * 1000).toISOString() : null,
  trial_ends_at: subscription.trial_end ? new Date(subscription.trial_end * 1000).toISOString() : null,
  is_trial: !!subscription.trial_end, // ✅ Added
  cancel_at_period_end: subscription.cancel_at_period_end,
  auto_renew_enabled: !subscription.cancel_at_period_end, // ✅ Added
});
```

### 2. Updated Premium Status Check

**File:** `MirrorMate/Services/StripeManager.swift`

**Before:**
```swift
.eq("status", value: "active")  // Only checked "active"
```

**After:**
```swift
.in("status", value: ["active", "trialing"])  // Checks both!
```

**Why?** Your checkout includes a 7-day trial, so subscriptions start as `trialing`, not `active`!

ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
