# 🚨 QUICK FIX - DO THIS NOW

## The "Product Not Available" error is fixed! 

You were using **StoreKit** (Apple in-app purchases), which requires an Apple Developer account and product setup.

I've switched you to **Stripe Checkout** (web payments) - much simpler!

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. ✅ Created `StripeManager.swift` - handles all payments
2. ✅ Updated `PaywallView.swift` - now uses Stripe
3. ✅ Updated `ProfileView.swift` - shows premium status from Stripe
4. ✅ Updated `MirrorMateApp.swift` - handles payment redirects
5. ✅ Updated `Info.plist` - added `mirrormate://` URL scheme
6. ✅ Deployed 3 Stripe functions to Supabase
7. ✅ Build successful

## ⚠️ YOU NEED TO DO 2 THINGS:

### 1. Fix Your Price ID (2 minutes)

**What you set:**
```bash
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=prod_TGNKCJCA5YI3Hm  ❌ This is a PRODUCT ID
```

**What you need:**
```bash
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_XXXXX  ✅ This is a PRICE ID
```

**How to fix:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/products/prod_TGNKCJCA5YI3Hm
2. Look in "Pricing" section
3. Copy the ID that starts with `price_` (not `prod_`)
4. Run:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/khubairnasirm/Desktop/MirrorMate
   npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_YOUR_PRICE_ID
   ```

### 2. Set Up Webhook (5 minutes)

**Why:** So subscriptions save to your database!

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **"+ Add endpoint"**
3. Endpoint URL:
   ```
   https://lchudacxfedkylmjbdsz.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
   ```
4. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**
6. Copy the **signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
7. Run:
   ```bash
   npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET
   ```
8. Test it: Click **"Send test webhook"** → Should show ✅ 200
