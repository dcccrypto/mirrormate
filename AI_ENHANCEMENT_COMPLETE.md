  ],
  
  "areasForImprovement": [

  ],
  
  "practiceExercises": [
    "Record yourself speaking for 30 seconds, then watch and count filler words. Try again aiming for 50% fewer.",

  ],

Practice the 'pause technique' - when you feel an 'um' coming, pause silently for 1 second instead. Your confident posture (88%) and facial expressiveness are major strengths - keep those!"
}
```

## üß† Advanced AI Prompting Techniques Used

### 1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting** ‚úÖ
Instead of asking for direct output, we guide the AI through a thinking process:

```
STEP 1: OBSERVE & COUNT
- Watch the ENTIRE video
- Count EVERY filler word
- Track vocal patterns...

STEP 2: ANALYZE
- How confident does this person appear?
- What's their pacing?
- How natural vs. rehearsed?...

STEP 3: IDENTIFY PATTERNS
- When do filler words cluster?
- Does energy spike/drop?...

STEP 4: GENERATE INSIGHTS
- TOP 3 strengths with evidence
- TOP 3 improvements with advice
- Practice exercises they can do TODAY
```

**Result:** AI thinks step-by-step like a professional coach, not just pattern matching.

---

### 2. **Few-Shot Prompting with Examples** ‚úÖ
We provide examples of GOOD vs BAD feedback:

```
Example of GOOD feedback:
"You maintained excellent eye contact (90%) and spoke clearly throughout 
the 28-second video. However, you used 8 filler words ('um' appeared 5 
times)...Practice the 'pause technique'..."

Example of BAD feedback:
"Good job! You did well. Try to improve your speaking skills."
```

**Result:** AI understands what "specific and actionable" actually means.

---

### 3. **Structured Output with Validation** ‚úÖ
We define exact JSON schema with validation rules:

```
CRITICAL RULES:
‚úÖ Count filler words ACCURATELY
‚úÖ Base durationSec on ACTUAL video observation
‚úÖ emotionBreakdown MUST sum to exactly 1.0
‚úÖ Be SPECIFIC in feedback - use actual numbers
‚úÖ Make recommendations ACTIONABLE
```

**Result:** Consistent, parseable, high-quality output every time.

---

### 4. **Role-Based Prompting** ‚úÖ
```
"You are an expert communication coach with 20 years of experience 
analyzing presentations, interviews, and public speaking. You've coached 
Fortune 500 executives, TED speakers, and professional communicators."
```

**Result:** AI adopts expert persona and provides professional-grade analysis.

---

### 5. **Explicit Task Decomposition** ‚úÖ
Break complex analysis into clear subtasks:
- Vocal Analysis (5 metrics)
- Body Language Analysis (5 metrics)
- Strengths Identification (3 items)
- Improvement Areas (3 items)
- Practice Exercises (3 items)
- Key Moments Timeline

**Result:** Comprehensive coverage of all communication aspects.

## üìà New Metrics Explained

### Vocal Analysis (5 Metrics)
1. **Pace (words/min)**: 120-180 = moderate, <120 = slow, >180 = fast
2. **Volume Consistency**: 0-1, how steady is volume
3. **Tonal Variety**: 0-1, variety vs. monotone
4. **Clarity**: 0-1, pronunciation quality
5. **Pause Effectiveness**: 0-1, strategic vs. awkward pauses

### Body Language Analysis (5 Metrics)
1. **Posture Score**: 0-1, upright/open vs. slouched/closed
2. **Gesture Naturalness**: 0-1, purposeful vs. fidgety
3. **Facial Expressiveness**: 0-1, animated vs. flat
4. **Eye Contact %**: 0-1, time looking at camera
5. **Movement Purpose**: 0-1, intentional vs. nervous shifting

## üíæ Database Schema Updates

### New Columns in `analysis_reports`:
```sql
vocal_analysis jsonb DEFAULT '{}'
body_language_analysis jsonb DEFAULT '{}'
strengths text[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]
areas_for_improvement text[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]
practice_exercises text[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]
key_moments jsonb DEFAULT '[]'
```

### Indexes for Performance:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_analysis_reports_strengths ON analysis_reports USING GIN (strengths);
CREATE INDEX idx_analysis_reports_improvements ON analysis_reports USING GIN (areas_for_improvement);
```

**Impact:** Fast queries for future features like:
- "Show me my top 3 strengths across all videos"
- "Track my improvement in filler words over time"
- "Find videos where I had good eye contact"

---

## üîß Technical Improvements

### 1. **Video Duration Fix** ‚úÖ
```typescript
// OLD: Estimate from file size (inaccurate)
const durationSec = Math.round(videoSizeBytes / 200000);

// NEW: Ask Gemini to observe actual duration
"durationSec": <ACTUAL video duration in seconds - count carefully by observing the video>

// Store in session immediately
await supabase.from("sessions").update({ 
  duration_sec: estimatedDurationSec 
}).eq("id", sessionId);
```

**Result:** Accurate duration, not rough estimate.

---

### 2. **Enhanced Gemini Configuration** ‚úÖ
```typescript
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.4,        // Lower = more consistent, factual
  maxOutputTokens: 4096,   // 2x increase for comprehensive output
  topP: 0.95,             // Nucleus sampling
  topK: 40                // Top-K sampling
}
```

**Result:** More consistent, detailed, professional analysis.

---

### 3. **iOS Model Updates** ‚úÖ
```swift
struct AnalysisReport {
    // All original fields...
    
    // NEW: Enhanced fields (optional for backwards compatibility)
    let vocalAnalysis: VocalAnalysis?
    let bodyLanguageAnalysis: BodyLanguageAnalysis?
    let strengths: [String]?
    let areasForImprovement: [String]?
    let practiceExercises: [String]?
    let keyMoments: [KeyMoment]?
}
```

**Result:** App can display rich insights when available, gracefully handles old reports.
